    Bridging the Gap:
</h1>
<h1 align="center">
    The Torah System
</h1>
<h2 align="center">
    by Haim Poyzner
</h2>
<p>
    God can control all matter on Earth and how it behaves, any time He wants to; however, he choses not to. Some like Gerald Schroeder theorize that the laws
    of the universe, which God put into motion to begin with, take over when God does not directly manipulate matter; and according to this, what we perceive
    as ‘free will’ is merely these laws of the universe directing us when a spiritual contraction occurs, such as God relinquishing direct control. Such a
    discussion on ‘free will’ is beyond the scope of this study; however, it does raise questions as to why ‘free will’ is necessary in the first place. Aside
    from the Kabalistic view in which all actions of ‘free will’ eventually lead to the same destination preordained by God, is it actually possible that God
    observes our ‘free will’ as a tool of learning, i.e. an experiment? And if so, why? Or is it that God created us to give and share life, much like a mother
    would, so that someone else could feel the Godly feeling also? If the latter is true, then the Torah is the umbilical cord. It is the bridge in the gap
    between God and man.
</p>
<p>
    God crafted the events on Earth, from trivial to global, in a specific way so that the Torah would be transmitted to mankind. The theory of evolution of
    man from animals does not contradict this statement, because evolution itself was a tool God created in order to shape His ultimate followers into their
    present form. It should also be noted that these events include <em>everything </em>that had to happen in order for the Torah to be transmitted properly,
    including the development of the Hebrew alphabet, the technology of book writing, and the evolution of the brain; so someone like Moses could have the
    capacity to remember, record, and store the Torah for future generations.
</p>
<p>
    We are limited in anything we try to comprehend unless we also comprehend its source and the relation between that source and its present form or
    destination. This also means we are limited in our comprehension of the Torah by how much we comprehend <em>all</em> of the events that preceded it and
    were required for its transmission to us. In other words, in order to understand the Torah better, we have to study the creation of the Heavens and Earth,
    which is the source of the Torah, and how it eventually led to the transmission of the Torah to mankind. The source of anything will also contain its
    intention or design. For example, the source of a human being’s matter on Earth is in our eggs and sperm, which contain the physical design of how the
    human being will take shape (stored in our DNA).
</p>
<p>
    The Torah itself is also designed in this way. Every measurable sub-piece of the Torah like a word, verse, section, or parsha can be examined in a
    self-containing way; with each of these sub-pieces having their own source. The source of each piece contains the plan or design of the entire piece and
    can be found in the beginning of the piece itself (the first sub-section of the piece). The Torah can be divided using any sized pieces and sub pieces you
    want, but no matter how you slice the sub-pieces, the pattern will still serve its purpose to the reader. You have to be careful not to say that any
    specific ways of dividing up the Torah are wrong; however, the more deviant the measurements of division are from tradition, the more deviant the messages
    you might be deriving from studying the divisions.
</p>
<p>
    For this study I chose to use a specific hierarchy of divisions closest to those in use by Orthodox Jews, where <em>books</em> contain <em>parshas</em>,
    which contain <em>open sections</em>, which contain <em>verses</em>, which contain <em>words</em>, and which ultimately contain <em>letters</em>. Thus, the
    source of any <em>word</em> in the Torah is the first <em>letter</em>, the source of any <em>verse</em> in the Torah is the first <em>word</em>, the source
    of any <em>open section</em> in the Torah is the first <em>verse</em>, the source of any <em>parsha</em> in the Torah is the first <em>open section</em>,
    and the source of any book in the Torah is the first <em>parsha</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The relation between a measurable piece and its source can at times be easy, and at other times very difficult to comprehend. The first book of Moses,
    Bereisheet, for example, deals with the creation of the tribes of Israel. The source of this book (the first written sub-piece) is the parsha of
    Bereisheet, which also bears the same name as the book itself and deals with the creation of all mankind. In this case, the relation of the creation of the
    tribes of Israel to its source (the creation of mankind) is easy to understand because mankind had to be created and shaped in a specific way so that it
    would eventually yield the family of Israel. On the other hand, the harder to understand source relationships were the ones I found the most interesting
    and will be the focus of most of the writing from this point on.
</p>
<p>
    The first letter of the Torah, the letter ב (bet), is the source of the entire Torah. It is the Torah’s home and the purpose of the Torah is tied closely
    to this letter. Let me explain. Just like individual sections of the Torah have a source, each concept and pattern that reappears within the Torah also has
    a source. The first time the pattern appears in the scripture, it should be regarded as the source of the pattern, as well as an explanation of all
    subsequent recurrences of this pattern. Number patterns most definitely fall under this category. The source of the number <em>two </em>appears very early
    on in the Torah, in the first verse to be exact, when the Torah mentions the Heavens and Earth together. From this, we can draw that the explanation of
    every coupling pattern in the Torah is in fact connected in someway to the Heavens and Earth. More specifically, each coupling will have one item
    corresponding to the Heavens and one item corresponding to Earth.
</p>
<p>
    Pertaining to the first letter of the Torah, the letter ב (bet) is the <em>second </em>letter of the Hebrew alphabet. This is a testament to the Heavens
    and Earth being created so that the Torah could be transmitted to mankind so that it would serve as the link between the Heavens and the Earth; it keeps us
    Earthlings close to God, fulfilling a portion of God’s plan. This seemingly abstract concept is further strengthened and explained as we expand our study
from the first letter ב (bet) to the first word ת ' ש א ר ב (Bereisheet); and eventually to the first verse,    <em>In the beginning of God’s creating the Heavens and the Earth</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Bereisheet itself as a word is split into two pieces: The first part, ב (bet), which means ‘in’, and the second part ת ' ש א ר which means ‘beginning’.
    Parsing this word using the number pattern of <em>two</em> (the source of which are the dual concepts of Heavens and Earth), one can apply the sub-piece
    ‘beginning’ to the concept of ‘Heavens’ and the sub-piece ‘in’ to the concept of Earth to get some amazing revelations. Indeed this seems to hint at the
    idea that the Heavens were created first, and then the Earth.<strong> </strong>This also hints at the Earth being the center of all physical perception and
    identity, the ‘in’ of all human experience—our frame of reference. Furthermore, the opposite concepts of the sub-pieces of the word Bereisheet can also fit
    into this equation. The concept of ‘out’ (which is the opposite of ‘in’) can be applied to the concept of ‘Heavens’ by virtue of ‘in’ already being applied
    to the concept of Earth and the fact that we must maintain the opposite relationship of the concepts. In the same way, the concept of ‘end’ (which is the
    opposite of ‘beginning’) can be applied to the concept of Earth. This is a gloomy insight into the Earth, our finite frame of reference, having an eventual
end. In contrast, the Heavens, which we look out towards, allow us to escape this fate by taking our mind back to the beginning. By immersing ourselves<em>in</em> the study of the Torah we can be linked to the Heavens and ultimately to God with the hopes that he saves our souls when it’s time to leave    <em>out</em> of the body.
</p>
<p>
    But why did we assign ‘in’ to the Earth and ‘beginning’ to the Heavens instead of the other way around? Well, try it for yourself: If the assignments were
    reversed, you would be implying that the Earth is actually the beginning and the Heavens are actually inside of us; as well as that the Heavens are the
    ultimate end and that the Earth is actually something external. Ironically this would be closer to something a scientist could say to explain life
    appearing on Earth by chance, life then manifesting some spiritual realm inside of itself, into which our souls would eventually collapse, and existence
    would simply cease. I chose not to associate the sub-pieces of Bereisheet in such a way because I felt that it contradicted my traditional beliefs and was
    something I simply did not want to believe in, not to mention that such a system would be illogical and completely incompatible with concepts found
    throughout the rest of this study.
</p>
<p>
    The first word of the Torah, the word Bereisheet, consists of six Hebrew letters: ת ' ש א ר ב. These six letters correspond to the first six <em>words</em>
of the first <em>verse</em> since the hierarchical system used to conduct this study (described earlier) places <em>letters</em> as sources of<em>words</em> as sources of <em>verses</em>. If the <em>source</em> of any Torah piece is split into sub-pieces, then those sub-pieces of the    <em>source</em> will correspond to the sub-pieces of the Torah piece itself <em>in the same order</em>. This rule seems to work very well in relationships
    between Torah pieces and their sources in the <em>letter-to-word-to-verse-to-section-to-parsha-to-book</em> hierarchy, but not always for other
    relationships which are outside of the hierarchy (like sub-pieces of words which are more than one letter).
</p>
<p>
The second word of the Torah, א ר ב (Bara), means <em>created</em> and also corresponds to Bereisheet’s second letter ר (resh). Again, in the<em>word-to-verse</em> hierarchy, the second <em>letter</em> of the source <em>word</em> (Bereisheet) will correspond to the second sub-piece of the    <em>verse</em> (in this case, the word Bara, <em>created)</em>. Thus, wherever you see the letter ר (resh), there will be an underlying connection to the
    process of creation. The fact that this is the <em>second</em> piece of the word Bereisheet, and for that matter the entire Torah, means that creation is
    the true source of the pattern of <em>two</em>, which we now know to represent the Heavens and the Earth. The resh letter in the word Bereisheet also
    happens to be the first part of the ת ' ש א ר segment which means ‘beginning’; in other words, the beginning of the beginning. Having earlier identified
    that the Heavens were created first, resh specifically alludes to the creation of the Heavens, a very special subject to think about. One should also note
    that the word Bara itself begins with the letter ב (bet), which alludes to the Torah, implying that the creation of the Heavens and the Earth began with
    the Torah. Now this might seem like we are building a circular concept here, but I will summarize what this has taught me so far:
</p>
<p>
    In order for God to create a link to living beings which would be perceiving their lives from a central physical point of reference, He had to create the
    Torah and pass it down to them in a very sophisticated, creative plan. For this, he created the Heavens, the Earth, and their entire array, including human
    beings—the great R<em>ashi </em>agrees with this concept: That the creation occurred for the sake of [humans] accepting and fulfilling the Torah.
</p>
<p>
The <em>third</em> <em>word</em> of Torah is the name of God, and its source in the <em>word</em> Bereisheet being the letter א (aleph), which is the    <em>third letter</em> in that <em>word</em>. Therefore wherever we find א (aleph), we also find the presence of God. God’s name actually starts with aleph,
    the <em>first</em> letter of the Hebrew alphabet. This most likely alludes to God’s oneness; that He <em>is </em>everything and everywhere and that we are
    but a tiny fragment of Him. But if He is everything and everywhere, then how can we, beings that perceive only the physical perceive him. The answer is
    that we can’t without his own intervention. Aleph exists inside of words but makes no sound; so too God exists but leaves no traces of his existence that
    we could perceive unless he wishes so. But what does it mean to be in God’s presence then? Perhaps it’s the feeling one gets when a raging bull is charging
    at them; a feeling of extreme awe, such as the one experienced by people who have witnessed God’s miracles firsthand. In any case, the Torah’s purpose is
    to bring us closer to God so that he may grace us with his presence, fulfilling the goal of creation.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>fourth word</em> of the Torah is ת א (Et). Being a participle in the <em>first</em> <em>verse</em>, its purpose is to explain that it was God who
    created the Heavens. When Jews make a blessing, God is referred to as The King of the Universe, but more importantly, He is considered the creator also.
    The source of the <em>word</em> Et is the <em>forth </em>letter of Bereisheet, ש (Shin). Thus, whenever we see the letter ש (Shin) in the Torah, there is a
    connection to the notion of God being the creator of the universe. The <em>word</em> Et also happens to begin with the letter א (aleph), which from what we
    learned earlier is another affirmation that He is the creator.
    <br/>
    The <em>fifth word</em> of the Torah is ם ' מ ש ה (HaShamaim), which means ‘The Heavens’. We have already identified The Heavens as being something outside
    of our limited frame of reference; they are all around us, but they are beyond our finite scope of understanding. The word HaShamaim, however, starts with
    Ha, which means ‘the’. Ha is a definite article that specifically identifies something, in other words, it explains the physicality of something. But if
    HaShamaim is referring to something physical, which we can perceive scientifically, then what is the location of The Heavens? Well, since we are quite
    aware of the physical aspects of our planet, we can derive that The Heavens are everything outside of Earth. This could only mean that for the purpose of
    human understanding, the Heavens are what in the scientific community is widely accepted as The Universe, which itself includes the Earth. In fact, we are
    but a tiny measurable piece of the infinitely immeasurable universe. Even though we think we know it’s size, highly respected string theorists will tell
    you that there are multiple dimensions which we can’t even begin to grasp at this moment in time. Yet all of this, the entire Universe, was made so that we
    could perceive God, using the laws of physics from our tiny planet.
</p>
<p>
    The source of the <em>word </em>HaShamaim is ' (yud), the <em>fifth letter</em> of the <em>word</em> Bereisheet. Yud is the smallest letter in the Hebrew
    alphabet. But how could the universe be explained with something so small? In this case, it is actually the full scope of our understanding of the Universe
    that is tiny, completely confined to what our finite minds can perceive. The <em>letter</em> yud is also lifted up off the ground, as if to indicate that
    it is above us in every possible meaning. The word HaShamaim has two sub-pieces, Ha and Shamaim. Using the coupling pattern of <em>two</em>, we can further
    confirm that Earth is the definite center of all physical perception in the universe; it houses the souls for which the Universe was built, in order for
humans to connect to God through the Torah. The pattern of <em>plurality</em> is first evident here since Shamaim is plural. Indeed, the concept of    <em>plurality</em> takes us away from the singular definition of something, like our finite point of reference. Thus, whenever we see things described as
    plural in the Torah, there is a connection there with The Universe (The Heavens), which, with all its galaxies, is not measurable and outside of our
    singularity.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>sixth</em> <em>word</em> of the Torah is ת א <strong>ו </strong>(V’et), being another participle in the <em>first</em> <em>verse</em>; its purpose
    is to explain that it was God who created the Earth. The earth being the center of all physical perception means that it was God who created physical
    perception itself. He can control all atoms, electrons, quarks…everything at will. Since we are the chosen beings to perceive God, and since our minds are
    also part of his universe, he can exist in our minds in a way that unifies the Godly and the physical. This is directly achieved through Torah study and is
    the goal of creation. Therefore as humans, this is our mission in life. The source of the <em>word</em> V’et is ת (tav), the <em>sixth</em> <em>letter</em>
    of the <em>word</em> Bereisheet. It is the last letter of the Hebrew Alphabet, once again indicating that this connection with God is the ultimate goal and
    purpose for human beings, our destination. All of our emotions and feelings we will face in our lifetimes, including pain, were all architected by the
    Creator in order for us to stay alive and achieve His desires, whatever they shall be.
</p>
<p>
    Tav happens to be the last <em>letter </em>in the <em>word</em> Bereisheet, the final piece of “searching for the beginning”, and the final piece of
    creation. Once Earth was fully created (including the creation of humans), creation was complete. It serves as the destination for Humans (as explained
    earlier), and as the representative for all destinations as a pattern. In other words, any last sub-piece of the Torah is the explanation of its goal and
    destination. To further solidify this point, the <em>word </em>V’et, which is represented by Tav, also ends with the <em>letter</em> Tav, which is saying
    our mission in life, a connection with God, is the destination of destinations.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>word</em> V’et is also the center of the coupling pattern in the <em>first verse</em>, bringing the Heavens together with the Earth. This makes
    perfect sense since the center of bridging this gap is the Human race’s mission to be closer to God through the study of the Torah. V’et signifies addition
    here, as the Earth was created in addition to the Heavens. The pattern of addition, therefore, is a perception of reality increasing, starting with Earth,
    the central physical point. The Earth, being the first item added to the Universe after it was deemed completed, was a starting point for life, the home of
    physical perception. V’et itself, can be broken down into two sub-pieces, V and Et. But in this coupling pattern neither sub-piece chooses to side with
    either the Heavens or the Earth; V, which means “and” is in between these two things being added, and Et, is a participle of ownership between God and the
    Earth. Perhaps this alludes to a perfect point in between, a point where there is no push or pull; a point for which creation happened, where God and man
    can be together in harmony.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>seventh </em>word of the <em>first verse </em>is ץ ר א ה (HaArets), which means ‘the Earth’. It has no source in the <em>first word</em> Bereisheet
    because that word only consists of <em>six</em> <em>letters.</em> This alludes to us having no easily verifiable way to prove the origins of Earth. This
    might be for the same reason that God does not present Himself to us at all times; he wants us to find him through our own free will. This is similar to a
    parent teaching a child to say “thank you” with sincerity and not because they have to. HaArets is the final <em>word </em>of the <em>first verse</em> of
    the Torah, “in the beginning of God’s creating the Heavens and the Earth.” This means that creation was indeed completed with the creation of the Earth,
    and ultimately man.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>second verse</em> of the Torah explains exactly at what moment in time God brought light into existence; however, since we already know that the
    universe was completed before God started creating the Earth, this ‘light’ could not have been the physical light explained by photons. If the Universe and
    all of its laws were already fully functional, including the strong, gravitational, electromagnetic, and weak forces, then physical light already existed
    in the form of electromagnetic force. Then what did God actually create when he brought ‘light’ into existence? God actually created the ability to
    perceive matter from a central physical point. The term ‘light’ here actually means defining what could be sensed by future life forms. It is the food that
    all life depends on. Brain cells, and for that matter, all nerve cells, interact with each other through an electromagnetic process. This means that this
    process drives all of our thoughts, including the very aspect of consciousness. But it is not this electromagnetic force that gives us our identity and
    point of reference in the universe; on the contrary, it’s actually the <em>perception</em> of this force that keeps us in existence. The electromagnetic
    force, responsible for light, would still exist if we never sensed it within our brains. This ability to perceive however, with witch all physical
    perception is possible, is what God brought into being after he said, “Let there be light.”
</p>
<p>
    The source of the <em>second verse</em> is the <em>word </em>Bara, the <em>second word </em>in<em> </em>the<em> first verse</em>. This is basically saying
    that creation had to start in order to eventually get to the specific moment at which the electromagnetic force could be perceived. We arrive at this
    moment through three descriptions, each with increasing specificity: It was a moment, during which Earth was <em>Tohu</em> and empty. More specifically, it
    was a moment during which there was darkness upon the surface of the waters. And even more specifically, it happened when God’s presence hovered upon the
    surface of the waters.
</p>
<p>
The <em>first word</em> of the <em>second verse</em> is V’HaArets, which means “when the Earth”. The source of V’HaArets is the <em>first</em>    <em>letter</em> of Bara, the letter bet, which represents the Torah. When the Earth was first formed, it became the starting point for creating physical
    perception. Eventually the Earth would have to be manipulated by God, to physically yield the Torah so that it could be transmitted to man, which is the
reason the Earth was created in the first place. The <em>second word </em>in this<em> verse </em>is Hyta, which means “was”. The source of Hyta is the    <em>second</em> <em>letter </em>of Bara, the letter resh, which represents creation. This is saying that physical perception actually began with the
    creation of the Earth; not that Earth itself could perceive, but that Earth would be the home of physical perception.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>verse</em> states that the Earth was Tohu V’Vohu, at the moment in time when God created the ability to perceive. The <em>word</em> Tohu is
    mysterious in meaning but we do know that its source in the word Bara is the <em>letter</em> aleph, which represents God. It is also used later in the
    Torah to describe the desolation in the wilderness. On the other hand, the word V’Vohu clearly means ‘and empty’. Applying the coupling pattern, we see
    that Tohu correlates to the Heavens, since its source is aleph, and V’Vohu correlates to the Earth. Both words must mean something similar, but from
    different standpoints. Perhaps Tohu can be explained as the emptiness that God perceived on Earth when it had no beings on it, which could in return
    perceive Him. Tohu starts with the <em>letter</em> tav, which represents our mission in life to connect with God. This clearly shows that the Tohu
    emptiness started with this mission being incomplete, as was the case when Earth was first created. It’s counterpart V’Vohu is then just describing the
    actual physical emptiness of the Earth. However, if there was nothing to perceive this emptiness yet, then how can it be explained? With further analysis
    after breaking down the word V’Vohu into sub-pieces and applying the coupling pattern again, we have the sub-piece V correlating to the Earth, and the
    sub-piece Vohu correlating to the Heavens. This shows that just like Tohu, the Vohu emptiness could only be perceived by God at that moment in time.
</p>
<p>
    As the moment, during which God created physical perception (the light), gets closer and more specific, we see that there is darkness on the surface of the
    deep waters. But darkness is actually the absence of light, and therefore the absence of perception. Before God created the light, perception in the
    Universe simply didn’t exist, and the whole Universe was in darkness. Darkness is the true color of the Universe, but for us, light is the only thing that
    we can sense. In fact, it is impossible for us to truly sense the universe, because our entire domain of reference is only what we can perceive through our
    brains. It’s kind of like the mathematical equivalent of going from <em>one</em> to <em>zero</em>. If we were consider <em>one</em> as being everything we
    perceive, we see that this is something given to us by God, the true One and the source of our perception. <em>Zero </em>would then represent everything we
    don’t sense in the Universe, it is the unknown, and the state in which the Universe was before we were ever created.
</p>
<p>
    Having identified that the state of the Universe was in ‘darkness’, we now see that God focused on the surface of the deep waters as a physical location.
    This physical location was in fact the border between the Universe and the Earth. The difference between these two domains is very important. The entire
    Universe is what God perceives, Earth included; we on the other hand, can’t perceive past the domain of Earth, the initial object we were formed from. This
    border separates between God’s perception and our perception:
</p>
<p>
    Imagine if you were sitting in a bath and that the surface of the bath water represented a border, which if any part of you crossed, would then become an
    independently thinking object with its own frame of reference. Now imagine taking your hand and dipping your fingers half way down into the water so that
    the palm of your hand would still hover over the water. Now each finger would then perceive itself and the other fingers as independent beings. Now if
    these finger beings could not see up and out of the water to realize that they are all part of the same hand, then you, the owner of the hand would be the
    only one to see the full picture. You would be still connected to the fingers, but the fingers would now act independently on their own, not realizing that
    they are all one, and the same being.
</p>
<p>
    The word Al-P’nei is used here in the <em>verse</em> to mean “upon the surface”. Since the word is actually a composition of two words, Al and P’nei, we
    can surely apply the coupling pattern for further explanation. Al means “upon” and is alluding to a physical location, much like the word Ha, so it must
    correlate with the Earth; meanwhile, P’nei, which means “surface” correlates with the Heavens. P’nei actually ends with the <em>letter</em> yud, which
    stands for the Universe. This confirms that the surface itself was the border between the two domains, since one of its “ends” was the Universe.
